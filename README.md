# CS50p - Python Problem Set Solutions

Welcome to my CS50p - Python Problem Set Solutions repository! This repository contains my solutions for the weekly problem sets from Week 1 to Week 10 for Harvard University's CS50p course. CS50p is an introduction to computer science using Python programming language, and these solutions represent my efforts in mastering Python and fundamental programming concepts.

## Repository Contents

- **Week 1 to Week 10 Solutions:** Each folder corresponds to a specific week's problem set. Inside each folder, you will find my solutions to the respective Python programming challenges.

## How to Navigate

1. **Browse Weekly Problem Sets:** Navigate to the specific week's folder you're interested in.
2. **Explore Python Solutions:** Inside each week's folder, you'll find Python files showcasing my solutions to individual problem set questions. The code files are named descriptively to help you understand their purpose.

Feel free to explore, learn, and even provide feedback or improvements if you find ways to optimize the Python solutions. These solutions are meant to serve as references to Python programming concepts and problem-solving techniques.

## How to Use

If you're a CS50p student or someone learning Python, you can use these solutions as a reference or a guide to understanding various Python programming techniques. However, I encourage you to attempt the problems on your own before exploring the solutions. Learning through problem-solving is a valuable skill in programming.

## Contribution

If you find any issues with the solutions or have suggestions for improvements, please feel free to open an issue or create a pull request. I welcome contributions and collaboration to make these Python solutions more comprehensive and helpful for the community.

Thank you for visiting my CS50p - Python Problem Set Solutions repository! Happy coding in Python! ðŸ˜Š
